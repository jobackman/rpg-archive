# NPCs

Mr. E. Lapham Peabody, 61, is the Arkham Historical Society's curator since over 30 years back. He is expert in local genealogy. He has also a working knowledge
of most of the church and town records, library holdings, historical societies, and graveyards found in the Miskatonic Valley region. Peabody is a valuable ally in
research, one quite likely to be willing to help solve a complicated genealogical puzzle.

Retribution Phillips, age 100 years, lives in a small 17th century house along Sutton Road off the Aylesbury Pike, where his forebears have dwelled for over 200 years.
Grampa Phillips is a very friendly and social man who has a severe hearing impairment which unfortunately makes him mishear things, but he is not so troubled by that.
He also have a good access to quite good quality moonshine, either he knows someone who produces it, or perhaps he does it himself.
