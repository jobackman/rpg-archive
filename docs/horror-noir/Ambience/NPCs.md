# NPCs
On this page I will collect all NPC's you interact with, some of them will be neighbors or other reoccuring characters, but also some characters that show up in some specific cases, that could perhaps reoccur.

Mr. E. Lapham Peabody, 61, is the Arkham Historical Society's curator since over 30 years back. He is expert in local genealogy. He has also a working knowledge
of most of the church and town records, library holdings, historical societies, and graveyards found in the Miskatonic Valley region. Peabody is a valuable ally in
research, one quite likely to be willing to help solve a complicated genealogical puzzle.
