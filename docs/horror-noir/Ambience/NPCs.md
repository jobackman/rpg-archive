was camping outside Arkham, they got attacked by Sermon Bishop who killed Richard, and swapped body with Henry. Later Sermon Bishop died with Henry's body, Henry had no
other possibility than continue to live in this old mans body. Herbert Cardigan, Richard's dad, had a good eye to Henry, and also felt sorry for him and gave him a
starting capital, to start a new life and also helped to generate papers for the Henry Atwater's "granddad" Henry Atwater Sr.
