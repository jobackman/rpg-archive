Mr. E. Lapham Peabody, 61, is the Arkham Historical Society's curator since over 30 years back. He is expert in local genealogy. He has also a working knowledge
of most of the church and town records, library holdings, historical societies, and graveyards found in the Miskatonic Valley region. Peabody is a valuable ally in
research, one quite likely to be willing to help solve a complicated genealogical puzzle.

Henry Atwater Sr. is actually the young student Henry Atwater in Sermon Bishop's undying body. When the now late Richard Cardigan and Henry Atwater in late October 1921
was camping outside Arkham, they got attacked by Sermon Bishop who killed Richard, and swapped body with Henry. Later Sermon Bishop died with Henry's body, Henry had no
other possibility than continue to live in this old mans body. Herbert Cardigan, Richard's dad, had a good eye to Henry, and also felt sorry for him and gave him a
starting capital, to start a new life and also helped to generate papers for the Henry Atwater's granddad Henry Atwater Sr.

When Henry was found in Bishop's body he was in quite bad condition, but healed surprisingly fast and well.

Retribution Phillips, age 100 years, lives in a small 17th century house along Sutton Road off the Aylesbury Pike, where his forebears have dwelled for over 200 years.
Grampa Phillips is a very friendly and social man who has a severe hearing impairment which unfortunately makes him mishear things, but he is not so troubled by that.
He also have a good access to quite good quality moonshine, either he knows someone who produces it, or perhaps he does it himself.
