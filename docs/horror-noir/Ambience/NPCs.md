was camping outside Arkham, they got attacked by Sermon Bishop who killed Richard, and swapped body with Henry. Later Sermon Bishop died with Henry's body, Henry had no
other possibility than continue to live in this old mans body. Herbert Cardigan, Richard's dad, had a good eye to Henry, and also felt sorry for him and gave him a
starting capital, to start a new life and also helped to generate papers for the Henry Atwater's "granddad" Henry Atwater Sr.

Victoria is another neigbor to Thelma, living at 458 W. Derby Street. In the worst looking house in the neighborhood, but that isn’t saying much considering the
competition. A brick and stone bungalow that would look better set in the countryside than the suburbs, but beautiful nonetheless. And the owner really takes good
care of both the garden and the interior of the house. Victoria is a widow aged 71. She has lived in this neighborhood since the day construction finished in 1870,
over 50 years ago. Since her husband died, 17 years ago, she mostly keep by herself, and don’t talk that much with her neighbors.
