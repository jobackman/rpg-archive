# Arkham
## How to Find Arkham
Arkham is in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, not far from the Atlantic Ocean,
athwart the banks of the Miskatonic River, about 30 kilometers NNE of Boston,
a little more than 23 kilometers south of Newburyport.
Travelers reach it by car, bus, train, or small boat.
Fare for the B&O commuter train from Boston is $2.20, and from Newburyport is $1.40.

## Arkham's Climate
Arkham receives three or more inches of precipitation monthly throughout the year.
Summer and fall thunderstorms are likely; occasionally a great hurricane swoops north.
Winter storms occasionally can be severe. Temperature varies more than rainfall.
Early October shows Arkham's trees in full autumn color. The hills become fabulous carpets of reds, yellows, and golds.
Temperatures are brisk, with nighttime as lows as 4 degrees and daytime
as highs as 15 degrees.
By November, fallen leaves litter everywhere, and the trees are nearly bare.
Occasional light snow-showers occur as early as late November, but the snow does not last, and Arkham rarely enjoys a white Christmas.
January and February are cold, when low temperatures are normally between -6°C and -1°C. Anything lower than -10°C is considered remarkable.
On the first weekend of February the town now celebrates Winterfest, a recently-established commercial festival.
The merchants sponsor a parade, a snowman-building contest, and an indoor pageant to select an annual Winter Queen to rule over the festival.
Winter thaws in March, but cool temperatures can last into early April. By the end of April, flowers begin to bloom and the trees begin to leaf.
May and June bring the first 20°C days, and July the first summer heat. In August, when the onshore breezes fail, temperatures can soar to 35°C and more.
The air hangs in the valley, humid and stagnant, creating uncomfortably sticky days and nights. These periods are usually short, however,
and temperatures above 30°C are exceptional. In general, the evenings cool off considerably and, especially near the river, a light jacket might be considered.
The Miskatonic is often cool for comfortable swimming, though hearty souls and young men showing off regularly make the plunge.
In September, the weather cools, and the first light frost may fall at the end of the month. This time is sunny and breezy, with scattered showers.
Students return to school, leaves turn, and the cycle begins again.
