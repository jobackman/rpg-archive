Thelma started this agency when her friend Loretta Madison got killed and the police could not solve the crime.
With some minor help from her friends Tristan and James she solved the crime, and found the murderer.
Thelma had talent for the art of investigation, and with her connections among the crème de la crème, she got hired to solve several cases that required discretion.

In the fall of 1921, John Q. Wood the U.S. consul in Venice and an old friend of Thelma, convinced Thelma to be responsible for the security of the consulate.
With 29.000 americans visiting Venice every year, it was a quite busy place.

The assignment was interesting enough for Thelma to first convince Tristan som become a full time investigator, and giving him the responsibility to take care of the
bureau and its good reputation, and later she also convinced James to become a part-time investigator and to keep an eye on Tristan and the Bureau.
