# Origin of House Galas

A couple of centuries ago the hero Malibus Galas claimed the throne of Kamhro by slaying the great beast Bahamut. Kamhro culture demands that the strongest and most cunning man is king so he was sworn in with the blessing of the populace. His reign was to be short though, he made many demands on the people but the one demand that made his popularity turn was when he claimed every woman of age into his personal harem. With his popularity all but gone the elite started to scheme against him, he would soon be overthrown. But Malibus is known for his wits, before the traitors made their move he and his loyalists had left at night with his harem, slaves, treasure, and all Kahuros. By spreading false rumours, covering his tracks, and with the use of decoys, he made a fool out of his pursuers.

They moved into the Kingdom of Zeraphin where Malibus were granted land and title by King Ethard II the gracious thus becoming his vassal. He decided to do what no lord before had dared to do and build his stronghold on top of the legendary floating rocks of Kiel.

But Kamhro desperately wanted their women back and soon learned of Malibus's location. They sent an army to return what was taken and to bring Malibus to justice. However, Malibus anticipated this and devastated their army in an ambush as they passed the Chescht mountain. When what was left of the Kamhroian army reached the rocks of Kiel they realised the depth of their failure. There was no way to reach the rocks for an attack and the great pit of Kiel was too wide for their broken army to effectively siege. For a few days, the Kamhroeans shouted curses and challenges at Malibus. It is said that the only response they received was a hearty laugh emanating from the topmost rock where Malibus had placed his harem. Soon the Kamhroeans couldn’t stand the humiliation anymore and decided to march home broken and defeated. As a reward to his loyal men, Malibus announced that the doors to his harem would be open every year on the day of the Kamhroean defeat. To celebrate the strength of Galas and their dominance over Kamhro.

The Kamhroeans would not return again for their women, instead, they doubled their raiding efforts—kidnapping women where they could as they sailed across the coast. They say that without the sacred power of their Kahuro steeds women are no longer born in Kamhro. That is why they are known as the kidnapper of women even to this day.
