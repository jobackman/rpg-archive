## Āśrama
A dwarf's life can go through several stages, known as _Āśrama_. It is not mandatory to go through all of them, but it is considered a positive thing. Childhood and old age are not really stages that one focuses on, as they simply happen or exist and are not something one strives for or achieves.

1. **Brahmach** This is the stage when one is an apprentice, following a Gurkul (Master) and learning about science, philosophy, logic, self-discipline, and how to live life according to the dwarven Dharma (Righteousness, Morality, Duties).
2. **Kahmach** This is the stage where one essentially breaks away from everything learned during Brahmach and independently learns to live life according to the dwarven Artha (Desire, Excitement, Freedom).
3. **Grihmach** This is the stage where one settles down, usually in a dwarven society, and together with their family, learns to live according to the dwarven Prashta (Loyalty, Wealth, Offspring).
4. **Sahnmach** This is the stage where one gives of themselves to future generations by taking on the role of a Gurkul and mentoring one or more apprentices, thereby living according to the dwarven Mochsha (Repetition, Perfection, Delegation).
