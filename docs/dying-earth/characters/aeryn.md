## Beliefs

1. There is no justice, only what a man can seize for himself—I will never be cheated again.
2. Gold is only worth the blade that protects it. I will make a fortune, but I will make it with steel.
3. The past is a graveyard, and I will not let my ghosts weigh me down. But if I ever meet that traitor again…

## Traits

- **Wolf’s Gut Instinct**: He can sense a bad deal before it’s offered, and a liar before they open their mouth.
- **Scarred Hands**: The marks of lost duels, betrayals, and too many years gripping a sword hilt.
- **Hates Bugs**: His loathing of insects borders on phobic, and the world is full of crawling things.
