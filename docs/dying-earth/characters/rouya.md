## Beliefs:

1. The world calls me cursed, but my sister needs me—I will wield this affliction and defy their superstitions.
2. The gods are not beyond reach, and neither is Nikou. If I must step into the shadows to find her, I will.
3. Flesh is clay—I shape it, I mend it, and if need be, I unmake it.

## Instincts:

- Always tend to the wounded, no matter who they are.
- Keep my arm covered, but never forget that it hungers.
- When faced with a supernatural presence, I speak first in the name of Enja.

## Traits:

- Whispering Limb: The parasitic mouth in her arm murmurs secrets only she can hear… some useful, some maddening.
- Silver-Tainted Eyes: Her gaze is unsettling, her pupils reflecting light like a cat’s.
- Wound-Binder: Even a fatal wound in her hands becomes “merely inconvenient.”
