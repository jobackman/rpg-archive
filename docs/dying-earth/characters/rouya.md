## Beliefs:

- The gods are not beyond reach, and neither is Nikou. If I must step into the shadows to find her, I will.
- The world calls me cursed, but my sister needs me—I will wield this affliction and defy their superstitions.
- The weak cling to what they are. The strong accept what they must become.

## Instincts:

- If someone is broken, i will _fix_ them.
- Keep my arm covered, but never forget that it hungers, just like me.
- If the darkness calls, I must answer

## Traits:

- **Whispers of the Maw**: Uzdhal Goros never stops whispering, and sometimes she listens. Whether it's an urge to feed, a dark secret, or a vision of ruin, the parasite's voice is always with her.
- **Scholar of Divine and Arcane Truths**: Rouya is not just a follower—she is a seeker. No text is too dangerous, no artifact too cursed, no revelation too blasphemous. She will devour all knowledge, divine or profane.
- **Flesh is but Clay**: Flesh is clay—I shape it, I mend it, and if need be, unmake it. It is something imperfect, mutable, and meant to be reshaped. Whether through healing or mutilation, I work without hesitation or doubt.”

## Timeskip RPGPT Ideas:

### Q: I would like her to lean into the occult more and the uzdhal goros infected arm, listening more to its influence and communing with uzdhal goros in secret

The years have not been kind to Rouya. The loss of the keep, the scattering of allies, and the endless struggle for survival have stripped away much of what she once was. She has been forced to embrace the one thing that has never abandoned her: **the voice in her arm**.
The parasite has spread. What was once just a face on her palm has grown, its influence sinking deeper into her flesh, into her mind. Her arm, now a pulsating, veined mass of **dark, shifting tissue**, is covered in **whispering mouths, blinking eyes, and twisting, bony protrusions**. When it is still, it resembles a grotesque, clawed limb wrapped in black, sinewy tendrils—but it is never truly still. It writhes, it murmurs, it hungers.

She no longer fights it. Instead, **she has learned to listen**.

### Q: She should also be getting more obsessed about the arcane and magical artifacts, not only for the intention of curing Nikou but for her own interest and power

_"All things decay, all flesh is transient. But magic... magic remains."_

The Rouya of old—gentle, hopeful, desperate for salvation—is long gone. Over the years, she has come to see magic not just as a tool, but as a truth greater than mortal existence. The artifacts of the old world, the lost knowledge of vanished empires, the relics of forgotten gods—these are what matter.

What began as a search to save Nikou has warped into an insatiable hunger. She no longer seeks just to restore her sister but to unlock the secrets of the ancients, to remake herself into something beyond human limitations.
She hoards artifacts, tomes, and forbidden knowledge, constantly seeking more. It is no longer just about Nikou—it is about Rouya transcending flesh, transcending mortality.

### An Obsession with the Past

Rouya has spent years digging through ruins, bargaining with spirits, and deciphering half-rotted texts in pursuit of arcane secrets. She sees history not as a lesson but as a vault—a place where power lies buried, waiting to be reclaimed.

- She seeks the remnants of fallen empires—especially those with magitech, necromantic relics, or reality-warping artifacts.
- She has become fluent in dead tongues, able to read the sigils and incantations of civilizations long turned to dust.
- She follows whispers, rumors, and forgotten legends, tracking down anything that might still contain a spark of lost power.

She does not care who she must deal with—bandits, merchants, cultists, demons—so long as they can lead her to the knowledge she craves.

### The Parasite Has Changed Her

The influence of Uzdhal Goros has reshaped not only her body but her mind.

- Her right arm has become a thing of unnatural flesh, a shifting, veined horror covered in eyes, whispering mouths, and bony protrusions. It no longer obeys her entirely—it reacts on its own, reaching out to touch artifacts or offering unwanted knowledge.
- It craves artifacts as much as she does. Some relics pulse when she touches them, as if they recognize her. Some whisper to her in languages she should not know. Some burn her with terrible visions.
- She has started dreaming in symbols, seeing ancient equations and sigils in her sleep, muttering prayers to Uzdhal Goros without realizing it.

She tells herself she is still in control. That may not be true.

Is she still Rouya? Or is she something else wearing her face?
