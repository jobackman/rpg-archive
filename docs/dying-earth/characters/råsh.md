## Description

R√•sh is a young dwarf of 78 years and for many decades he served as an apprentice to master artificer Urist. Urist and R√•sh were sent on exile from their Dwarven home because Urist's great plan didn‚Äôt align with the rest of the society. Like most dwarves R√•sh has an incredible intuition when it comes to craft, ancient technology and machines at large. He and his master designed the brass arm that Jerryfucious is wearing. He has been in debt to the party after they helped him save his master (Urist) and has sworn to help them until the debt is repaid. R√•sh has two brass scarabs that can fly and scout ahead; they were made by master Urist but are now maintained by R√•sh. He is known to be a bit womanizer and is touched deeply by fine craftsmanship.

> ### Beliefs
> 
> 1. The gods made Dwarves for machines, not men‚Äîif I craft something grand enough, they will take me back.
> 2. Jerryfucious and his brass arm are proof that I am the finest craftsman in Seraphin. I will make him greater, and through him, myself.
> 3. If I die without creating something that the world will remember, I may as well have never lived.

> ### Instincts
> 
> 1. Always touch a new machine before working on it; feel its soul.
> 2. When someone speaks of lost knowledge, take notes.
> 3. Keep my scarabs close; they hear things I do not.

> ### Traits
> 
> 1. **Great Plan‚Äôs Curse:** His obsession with invention keeps him awake at night and distracted at the worst times.
> 2. **Smell for Metal:** He can identify alloys by scent alone.
> 3. **Hopeless Romantic:** Falls for beauty, in craft and in people, with equal passion.
