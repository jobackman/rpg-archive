## Beliefs:

1. I am nobler than the dogs who cast me out, and I will prove it by carving my name into history.
2. The strong claim their place, but the cunning keep it—Illargo’s back bears my mark, and I will see his throne overturned.
3. My brass arm is the hand of progress. If I uncover the right knowledge, I will wield power that even the ancients feared.

## Instincts:

- Never show weakness—smile even as you bleed.
- Always test a lock, a door, or a mechanism for hidden secrets.
- If insulted, turn it into a joke at the other’s expense.

## Traits:

- Brass-Forged Grip: His mechanical arm is both a blessing and a curse, an artifact that sometimes acts on its own.
- Golden Arrogance: His confidence is infectious, but it may be his doom.
- Mocking Laugh: A scornful cackle that often slips out at the worst possible moment.
