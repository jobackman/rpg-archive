# Osmunds outlaw camp
## ADA
![alt text](<NPC-Ada.png>)
__Description:__ Ada is a 15-year-old girl with long, dark brown hair, usually worn in a simple braid. Her hazel eyes have a thoughtful, watchful look, suggesting maturity beyond her years. Though youthful, her face has a few freckles, and her slim, wiry build shows the demands of life in the outlaw camp. She wears practical, hand-me-down clothes, often rolling up the sleeves. Ada helps her mother, Ellyn, around the camp, and carries a small dagger at her belt, ready to defend herself if needed. Her demeanour is quiet and cautious, but there's a hint of curiosity and determination. 

__Relationships:__ Daughter to Ellyn, Stepdaughter to Wulfstan

## AGNES the WITCH
__Description:__ Is a young woman in her early twenties, who had to flee after she was accused of witchcraft by a neighbouring village. Her hair is auburn, falling in loose waves to her shoulders, often kept tucked behind her ears or tied back when she is focused on a task. She wears simple, worn clothing — handmade tunics and a patchwork cloak, practical for survival in the woods. Agnes is usually seen gathering herbs or weaving small charms from twigs, a habit that harks back to the superstitions that led to her accusations of witchcraft.

__Relationships:__ Partner to Cutbert

__Archetype:__ Cunning folk (Wortcunner)

## ALARIC the BLACKSMITH
__Description:__ A burly man in his early forties with a thick, unruly beard and powerful arms that speak to his years of work at the forge. His hands are calloused, and there’s a permanent smell of soot about him. He wears a worn leather apron over a simple tunic, with a blackened hammer tucked into his belt. His face is often stern, but there’s a hint of warmth in his deep-set brown eyes.

__Relationships:__ Married to Mildred, father of Edwin.

__Archetype:__ Artificer (Blacksmith)

## ALICE
__Description:__ TBD

__Relationships:__ Daughter to Matilda

## ANSELM the COOPER
__Description:__ A sturdy man in his mid-fifties, with a thick beard streaked with grey and hands toughened by years of shaping wood. He has a missing finger on his left hand—a souvenir from a workshop accident long ago. Anselm wears a patched wool tunic and is always tinkering with woodwork, making small repairs around the camp. 
Anselm is practical and quiet, preferring the company of his tools to idle chatter. He lost his trade when he refused to pay a bribe demanded by a corrupt official, leading to accusations of theft that forced him to flee. 

__Relationships:__ He is very loyal to Brother Osmund. 

__Archetype:__ Artificer (Cooper/Barrel maker)

## BEATRICE the WEAVER
__Description:__ A woman in her late twenties with a quiet, gentle demeanour, Beatrice has dark, curly hair and a slender build. Her hands are always busy, weaving baskets or repairing clothing for the camp. She has a soft spot for the children in the camp, often telling them stories while she works. 
Beatrice is kind and patient, but she harbours a deep sadness. She lost her home and trade after being accused of spreading seditious rumours against a local lord, which she claims were exaggerated by rivals. She keeps to herself most of the time but is always willing to lend a hand to those in need. Her calm presence often helps to defuse tensions between the camp’s more hot-headed members. 

## CEDRIC the TANNER
__Description:__ Cedric is a wiry man in his early forties with a gaunt face and a permanent squint, the result of years working with hides and foul-smelling chemicals. He has shaggy, unkempt hair and is often seen wearing a thick leather apron, even in the camp. He’s practical and gruff, but he has a dry sense of humour that surfaces in unexpected moments. 
Cedric is a realist, never sugar-coating their situation but always focusing on what needs to be done to survive. He is fiercely loyal to Brother Osmund, having known him from his time in a nearby village, and respects Osmund’s vision of building a community rather than just a band of outlaws. He is suspicious of Gareth’s growing influence and keeps a close eye on him. 

__Relationships:__ Brother to Ymma (villager/alewife), Uncle to Bradwell.

## GARETH the WOODSMAN
__Description:__ Gareth is a burly, middle-aged man with a friendly smile and a booming laugh. He has short-cropped dark hair, a weathered face, and the rough hands of a man used to swinging an axe. He quickly makes newcomers feel welcome, sharing stories of his days in the woods and offering to help with camp tasks. 

__Archetype:__ Yeoman (Woodsman)

## HENRY

## HILDA the COOK
__Description:__ A robust woman in her forties with a ruddy complexion and a no-nonsense demeanour. She has her hair tied back in a simple cloth, and she’s often seen stirring a pot over the campfire or scolding others for wasting food. Despite her stern manner, she cares deeply about feeding the camp’s residents. 
Hilda was dismissed from her position after being accused of stealing from the pantry—an accusation she vehemently denies. She found a new sense of purpose among the outlaws, ensuring no one goes hungry. Hilda is protective of the children in the camp and has a soft spot for Beatrice, whom she treats like a younger sister. 

## HUGH the FORRESTER
__Description:__ A former forester who knows the Forest of Dean like the back of his hand. Hugh is lean and wiry, with a quiet, observant nature, making him an excellent scout. He often helps Meraud gather herbs from the forest and tends to the camp’s traps and snares. 

__Relationships:__ Partner of Meraud

__Archetype:__ Yeoman (Forester)

## MERAUD the HEALER 
__Description:__ A middle-aged woman with long, dark hair streaked with grey, tied back in a braid. Her clothes are practical, patched in several places, and she carries a satchel filled with various herbs and rudimentary medical supplies. Her hands are stained from years of working with plants and remedies. She has a gentle, calming presence, though her green eyes betray a fierce determination. 

__Relationships:__ Partner of Hugh

__Archetype:__ Cunning folk (Healer)

## MILDRED
__Description:__ A sturdy woman with a calm demeanour, her hands rough from years of working alongside Alaric in his former smithy. She helps organise the camp’s daily tasks, ensuring that everyone pulls their weight. Mildred is practical and protective, especially of her son Edwin, but she is also the first to offer a warm smile and a shared meal to newcomers. 

__Relationships:__ Married to Alaric, mother of Edwin. 

## OLD NED
__Description:__ A grizzled veteran of many outlaw bands, Ned is in his sixties, with a weathered face and a scar over one eye. He acts as a mentor to younger outlaws and has a wealth of stories about the forests, old battles, and the shifting loyalties of those who live outside the law. He’s also the camp’s unofficial leader when Brother Eadric is away. 

## OSWIN the FISHERMAN
__Description:__ A lean man in his thirties with a tanned face and salt-streaked hair. He carries a handmade fishing spear and is often seen near the stream, teaching others to fish or cleaning the day’s catch. He wears a rough, oil-stained tunic and keeps a simple pendant of a fish around his neck. 
Oswin is easygoing and good-natured, content with the simplicity of life in the woods. He fled his coastal village after being blamed for the disappearance of a nobleman’s goods during a storm—an accusation that was never proven but left him with no other choice. Oswin is a source of calming presence in the camp, often singing old sea shanties to lighten the mood. 

## RHEDA the WIDOW
__Description:__ A woman in her early fifties, with a stern face softened by the lines of grief. She wears simple woollen clothes, and her hands bear the marks of years spent working the fields. Rheda’s dark hair is streaked with grey, and she wears a silver brooch—a keepsake from her late husband. 
Rheda lost her husband during a raid by soldiers, who then seized their farm for a local lord. With nowhere else to go, she found her way to the outlaws. She has become a motherly figure in the camp, offering advice and helping with daily chores. Though she is quiet and reserved, she harbours a deep anger toward the nobility and supports any efforts to disrupt their control over the region. 

## WULFSTAN the CARTER
__Description:__ A lanky man in his thirties with a crooked nose that has clearly been broken more than once. His face is lean and gaunt, with a scruffy beard and sunburned skin from years of working outdoors. He wears a simple woollen cloak and boots that have seen better days. Despite his rough appearance, he has a quick wit and an easy smile, often trying to lighten the mood with his dry humour. 

__Relationships:__ Married to Ellyn, Stepfather of Ada

__Archetype:__ Skulker (Carter)
